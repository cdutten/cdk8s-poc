# cdk8s-poc
POC of CDK8s (https://cdk8s.io/)

I created this project as I wanted to learn how to use CDK8s
it looks as a great way of managing, in a scalable way, the deployment of applications

In the past I had the need of automatizing the provisioning of applications.
I always solved it with custom Python code.
The problem is that the setup and coding of that projects was always different and cost too much time.

## 

My POC is going to be composed of:
- An application (TBD which one) 
- A Secret mounted in a file in the application
- A Configmap used as env in the application
- A Service to expose the application


## Tasks
- [] Provision application
- [] Provision Secret mounted
- [] Provision Configmap
- [] Provision Service
